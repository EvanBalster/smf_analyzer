Place MIDI files in this directory and the Visual Studio project will scan them when run.
Alternatively, run the compiled application specifying an input directory followed by an output directory.

Subfolders are OK â€” the scanner will search recursively for SMF, MIDI, MID and KAR files.
(If more extensions are needed, edit them into SMF_EXTENSIONS in smf_analyzer.h)
